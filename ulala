Resolution:

Increased the local port range using below command:
echo 1024 65000 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range

This allows more local ports to be available.

Enable fast recycling TIME_WAIT sockets as below:
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle =1

By default,

cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle

Output : 0 (disabled by default)

Be cautious if enabled in production environments, since this is our internal Environment and machine used only for Jmeter load tests, we enabled recycle and resolved the issue.

Enable reuse of sockets as below:
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1

By default,

cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse

Output : 0 (disabled by default)

Note: The tcp_tw_reuse setting is particularly useful in environments where numerous short connections are open and left in TIME_WAIT state, such as web servers. Reusing the sockets can be very effective in reducing server load.

After enabling fast recycling and reuse the server could support 5K user Load with single Unix box.
